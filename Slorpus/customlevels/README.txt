INSTRUCTIONS FOR CUSTOM LEVELS:
1. Create multiple levels in the Not So Simple Level Designer
2. Use the NSSLD's custom level info generator to generate an info.wal file
3. put your levels AND the info.wal file into a folder, and move the folder to the customlevels directory in the Slorpus files
4. Type the name of the folder (11 char limit) in the custom level loader, and press the check box. The game will tell you if a custom level has been loaded.
5. Play the game as normal. The original levels will be swapped out for the custom ones.
